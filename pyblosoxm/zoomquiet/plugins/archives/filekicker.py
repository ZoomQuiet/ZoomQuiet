filekicker.py
A pyblosxom plugin.

http://snarfed.org/space/filekicker
Copyright 2006 Ryan Barrett

This plugin serves static files in the pyblosxom datadir. It looks for the
filename from the URL based at datadir. For example, if config['datadir'] is
'/home/ryanb/www/data', and a user requests http://mysite.com/foo/bar.py,
filekicker will send back the file /home/ryanb/www/data/foo/bar.py. Its MIME
type is inferred from its extension.

In other words, filekicker takes a static file and "kicks" it up into the
pyblosxom structure.
