Usage
=====

This plugin allows you to include static files outside of the entry
system.  Static files should probably be text files, though this plugin
could be improved to handle php, cgi and all that other non-static file
stuff.

It looks for urls like::

   /static/blah

and pulls up the file ``blah.txt`` [1] which is located in the path specified
in the config file as ``staticdir``.  If no staticdir is specified, then we
use the datadir.

If the file is not there, it kicks up a 404.

[1] The file ending (the ``.txt`` part) can be any file ending that's valid
for entries on your blog.  For example, if you have the textile
entryparser installed, then ``.txtl`` is also a valid file ending.

pystaticfile formats the page using the ``static`` template.
So you need to add a ``static.html`` file to your datadir (assuming
you're using the ``html`` flavour).  I tend to copy my story flavour
templates over and remove the date/time-related bits.

pystaticfile handles evaluating python code blocks.  Enclose python
code in ``<%`` and ``%>`` .  The assumption is that only you can edit your 
static files, so there are no restrictions (security or otherwise).

For example::

   <%
   print "testing"
   %>

   <%
   x = { "apple": 5, "banana": 6, "pear": 4 }
   for mem in x.keys():
      print "<li>%s - %s</li>" % (mem, x[mem])
   %>

The request object is available in python code blocks.  Reference it
by ``request``.  Example::

   <%
   config = request.getConfiguration()
   print "your datadir is: %s" % config["datadir"]
   %>
