"""
Quickly written plugin for paging long index pages.  

PyBlosxom uses the num_entries configuration variable to prevent
more than num_entries being rendered by cutting the list down
to num_entries entries.  So if your num_entries is set to 20, you
will only see the first 20 entries rendered.

The wbgpager overrides this functionality and allows for paging.
It does some dirty stuff so that PyBlosxom doesn't cut the list down
and then wbgpager cuts it down in the prepare callback later down
the line.

To install wbgpager, do the following:

  1. add "wbgpager" to your load_plugins list variable in your
     config.py file--make sure it's the first thing listed so
     that it has a chance to operate on the entry list before
     other plugins.
  2. add the $page_navigation variable to your head or foot
     (or both) templates.  this is where the page navigation
     HTML will appear.


Here are some additional configuration variables to adjust the 
behavior:

  wbgpager_count_from
    datatype:       int
    default value:  0
    description:    Some folks like their paging to start at 1--this
                    enables you to do that.

  wbgpager_previous_text
    datatype:       string
    default value:  &lt;&lt;
    description:    Allows you to change the text for the prev link.

  wbgpager_next_text
    datatype:       string
    default value:  &gt;&gt;
    description:    Allows you to change the text for the next link.

  wbgpager_linkstyle
    datatype:       integer
    default value:  0
    description:    This allows you to change the link style of the paging.
                    style 0:  [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... >>
                    style 1:  Page 1 of 4 >>


That should be it!


Note: This plugin doesn't work particularly well with static rendering.
The problem is that it relies on the querystring to figure out which
page to show and when you're static rendering, only the first page
is rendered.  This will require a lot of thought to fix.  If you are
someone who is passionate about fixing this issue, let me know.
