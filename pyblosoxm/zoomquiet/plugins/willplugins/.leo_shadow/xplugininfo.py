Summary
=======

This plugin is maintained at::

   http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/pyblosxom/

Check that URL for new versions, better documentation, and submitting
bug reports and feature requests.


Usage
=====

This plugin goes through all the plugins you have installed on your blog
and extracts information about the plugin.

To kick it off, the url starts with ``/plugin_info`` .

If there are plugins you want to run that you don't want showing up,
list them in the ``plugininfo_hide`` property of your ``config.py`` file::

   py["plugininfo_hide"] = ["myplugin", "myotherplugin"]

It takes a list of strings.
