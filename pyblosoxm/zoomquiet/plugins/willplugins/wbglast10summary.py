Summary
=======

Thrown-together plugin to summarize all entries after the first five
in the html flavour.

This uses the ``summary`` template.  So make sure to build a ``summary`` 
template file.  Also, you should probably fiddle with the values in this 
plugin to get it to meet your special needs.
