# plugins you name and we will load them in the order you name them.
# The "load_plugins" key is a list of strings where each string is
# the name of a plugin module (i.e. the filename without the .py at

# Caching configuration
# =====================

# Using Caching? Caching speeds up rendering the page that is going to be
# shown. Even if you are not using pyblosxom special features, caching can
# improve rendering speed of certain flavours that can show a large number of
# files at one time. Choose a cache mechanism you'd like, see the
# Pyblosxom/cache/ directory, and read the source on how to enable caching with
# the particular cache driver, you need to set two variables:
#py["cacheDriver"] = "xxxx"
#py["cacheConfig"] = ""
